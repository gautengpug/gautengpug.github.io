Title: About

The group was a (*very* low volume) Google Groups only discussion group, until
[Hussain](https://github.com/Kentoseth) took the initiative to organise a
meetup. Consequently, the [first meetup]({filename}/Blog Post 1.md) was hosted
on 12 April 2014 at [House4Hack](http://www.house4hack.co.za).

Honourary list of first meetup attendees:

  +  Frank
